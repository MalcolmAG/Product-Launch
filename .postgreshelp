I downloaded postgres with brew
I entered psql
I remade postgres user as a superuser (CREATE USER postgres SUPERUSER;)
I created a db called devdb (CREATE DATABASE devdb WITH OWNER postgres)

I ran pipenv run flask db upgrade [which needed devdb to exist and postgres superuer]
And then /devdb was connected, and I could look at it easilys

psql uses single quotes for strings
